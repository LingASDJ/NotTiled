This app is far from perfect and is under active development. Updates will be delivered each week. My goal is to make NotTiled a free, robust, and bug free tiled map editor for everyone.

I rarely read reviews, so please contact me via email or discord if you found bugs/errors or if you have any suggestions. Thank you.
