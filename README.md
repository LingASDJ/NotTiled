<h1>NotTiled </h1>
Latest version: 1.8.6

NotTiled is a simple 2D-map editor for gamers. It is based on Tiled Map Editor (https://www.mapeditor.org/) by Thorbj√∏rn Lindeijer.
Unlike Tiled, NotTiled is focused on creating custom maps for games. For example, NotTiled includes random map generator and tileset generator.
However, NotTiled features might be quite lacking for game developers (for example, there is no scripting feature).

Sample maps & tilesets included (credit to their own respective creators).

Features:  
- Create custom maps for games that support it, for example: Rusted Warfare, Remixed Dungeon, Stardew Valley, etc.
- Built in PNG editor.
- Multiplatform, available for Android, Windows, MacOS, and Linux. (iOS version can be made but it is currently not available in app store).
- Supports tmx, json, and png file format.
- Optimised for touch devices.
- Map and tileset generators.
- Can also be used for other purposes.

This app is far from perfect and is under active development. Updates will be delivered each week. My goal is to make NotTiled a free, robust, and bug free 2d map editor for everyone.

How to compile:
Just in case you want to compile the app yourself, just download it and open it using Android Studio, it should just work. Let me know if it does not work. thanks!
